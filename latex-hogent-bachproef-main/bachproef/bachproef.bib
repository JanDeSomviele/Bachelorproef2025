  abstract       = {The concepts of smart building (SB) and smart facilities management (SFM) are crucial as they aim to uplift occupants’ living standards through information and communication technology. However, the current network possesses several challenges to SFM, due to low bandwidth, high latency, and inability to connect a high amount of IoT (Internet of things) devices. 5G technology promises high-class network services with low latency, high bandwidth, and network slicing to achieve real-time efficiency. Moreover, 5G promises a more sustainable future as it will play a crucial role in reducing energy consumption and shaping future applications to achieve higher sustainability goals. This paper discusses the current challenges and benefits of implementing 5G in various use cases in SFM applications. Furthermore, this paper highlights the Singapore government rollout plan for 5G implementation and discusses the roadmap of SFM use case development initiatives undertaken by 5G Advanced BIM Lab (Department of Building, National University of Singapore) in alignment with the 5G implementation plan of Singapore. Under these 5G SFM projects, the lab seeks to develop state-of-the-art 5G use cases in collaboration with various industry partners and developed a framework for teaching and training to enhance students’ learning motivation and help mid-career professionals to upskill and upgrade themselves to reap multiple benefits using the 5G network. This article will serve as a benchmark for researchers and industries for future progress and development of SFM systems by leveraging 5G networks for higher sustainability targets and implementing teaching and learning programs to achieve greater organizational excellence.},

  abstract       = {With the growing need to obtain information about power consumption in buildings, it is necessary to investigate how to collect, store, and visualize such information using low-cost solutions. Currently, the available building management solutions are expensive and challenging to support small and medium-sized buildings. Unfortunately, not all buildings are intelligent, making it difficult to obtain such data from energy measurement devices and appliances or access such information. The internet of things (IoT) opens new opportunities to support real-time monitoring and control to achieve future smart buildings. This work proposes an IoT platform for remote monitoring and control of smart buildings, which consists of four-layer architecture: power layer, data acquisition layer, communication network layer, and application layer. The proposed platform allows data collection for energy consumption, data storage, and visualization. Various sensor nodes and measurement devices are considered to collect information on energy use from different building spaces. The proposed solution has been designed, implemented, and tested on a university campus considering three scenarios: an office, a classroom, and a laboratory. This work provides a guideline for future implementation of intelligent buildings using low-cost open-source solutions to enable building automation, minimize power consumption costs, and guarantee end-user comfort.},

While "smart" HVAC technologies, such as learning thermostats, are widely available for residential use, commercial buildings typically rely on legacy systems that are difficult to upgrade and require facility managers to manually set HVAC schedules. In this paper, we propose a novel Machine Learning-driven technique to automatically learn custom occupancy-based HVAC schedules for buildings across a large campus. While our technique is compatible with any occupancy sensor, we leverage the existing wireless networking infrastructure that is omnipresent across any modern campus. We analyze building WiFi activity, specifically from smartphones, to infer detailed spatial occupancy patterns in each building, and present an algorithm that learns from these patterns to derive a custom HVAC schedule. Our approach is adaptive and dynamically adjusts its schedules as occupancy patterns change, much like a learning thermostat. To evaluate our techniques, we analyze data from several thousand WiFi access points deployed in 112 office buildings on a university campus. Our analysis reveals significant differences in occupancy patterns across and within buildings, motivating the need for our adaptive learning-based approach. Compared to the current static approach, our results demonstrate that learning HVAC schedules from mobile WiFi activity across the campus can yield a 37\% reduction in waste time, a measure of energy savings, and a 3\% reduction in miss time, a measure of user comfort.},

By leveraging an existing asset management platform that integrates Building Information Modelling (BIM) and Geographic Information Systems (GIS), data from Internet of Things devices were linked to the BIM model of a test case building creating a digital shadow in order to gather real-time data on indoor conditions, including temperature, humidity, and CO2 levels. The methodology enables continuous evaluation of the building’s state of usage and calls for automatic and frequent updates of data. The digital shadow can display current usage conditions and alarms when conditions exceed what is comfortable, and it allows for immediate feedback through colours based on the internal detected conditions. The platform can be used with business intelligence tools to support strategic choices and enable future innovations, including machine learning techniques to estimate building occupancy and identify any deviations from expected usage patterns. This study presents a promising workflow for creating sustainable and comfortable educational buildings, which could be replicable and scalable in the future.},

Since up to two-thirds of the total consumed energy in buildings is dispended for Heating, Ventilation and Air Conditioning (HVAC) operations, intelligent control of HVAC loads is of utmost importance. The present work aims to offer a solution to improve a building microgrids’ flexibility by shifting thermal loads and taking advantage of room thermal inertia. Innovation is present in using the internet of things to link several decentralized local microcontrollers with the microgrid and in the applicability of different control algorithms, such as the pre-emptive heating/cooling of a room. The developed solution relies on smart thermostats, which can be integrated into a building management system, or in a microgrid, and are capable of fulfilling the occupants’ need for comfort while complementing the building with needed power flexibility. The equipment is capable of controlling several HVAC systems to guarantee thermal and air quality comfort, as well as coordinate with a building/microgrid operator to reduce energy costs by shifting thermal loads and enacting demand control strategies. The smart thermostat uses an algorithm to calculate room inertia and to pre-emptively heat/cool a room to the desired temperature, avoiding peak hours, taking advantage of variable tariffs for electricity, or periods of solar generation surplus. The smart thermostat was integrated into a university campus microgrid and tested in live classrooms. Since the work was developed during the COVID-19 pandemic, special attention was given to the air quality features. Results show that smart HVAC control is a viable way to provide occupant comfort, as well as contribute to the integration of renewable generation and increase energy efficiency in buildings and microgrids.},

  abstract     = {Smart homes are an element of developing smart cities. In recent years, countries around the world have spared no effort in promoting smart cities. Smart homes are an interesting technological advancement that can make people’s lives much more convenient. The development of smart homes involves multiple technological aspects, which include big data, mobile networks, cloud computing, Internet of Things, and even artificial intelligence. Digital information is the main component of signal control and flow in a smart home, while information security is another important aspect. In the event of equipment failure, the task of safeguarding the system’s information is of the utmost importance. Since smart homes are automatically controlled, the problem of mobile network security must be taken seriously. To address these issues, this paper focuses on information security, big data, mobile networks, cloud computing, and the Internet of Things. Security efficiency can be enhanced by using a Secure Hash Algorithm 256 (SHA-256), which is an authentication mechanism that, with the help of the user, can authenticate each interaction of a given device with a WebServer by using an encrypted username, password, and token. This framework could be used for an automated burglar alarm system, guest attendance monitoring, and light switches, all of which are easily integrated with any smart city base. In this way, IoT solutions can allow real-time monitoring and connection with central systems for automated burglar alarms. The monitoring framework is developed on the strength of the web application to obtain real-time display, storage, and warning functions for local or remote monitoring control. The monitoring system is stable and reliable when applying SHA-256.},

  abstract    = {Internet of Things (IoT) technologies attracted great attention and have increased applications in various industrial sectors, including smart buildings and building automation (BA) fields. Additionally, the emerging wireless network technologies have opened up a new and attractive alternative for the real-time energy management in the wireless manner, owing to the new features including ultra-reliable and low-latency communication in the networks. However, the functionality of IoT technologies in buildings applications are still very limited, as they are mostly used for monitoring and data collection, while data processing and control decisions are typically made centrally or remotely. With regard to building controls, as one of the fundamental tasks of building automation, the IoT technologies are only applied to those less or not time-critical tasks. The feasibility of IoT technologies applied to time-critical tasks, such as field-level process controls, still needs further investigations. Thus, a new control architecture is needed that adopts IoT and emerging network technologies, providing an alternative option for future BA systems to fully reap their benefits in applications of building automation and smart buildings with more flexibility.
This PhD study, therefore, aims to design and develop an appropriate architecture of networked field-level process control for air-conditioning systems implemented in IoT environments, with systematic analysis of the impacts of network uncertainties and component-level device characteristics. The optimization methods by different aspects are also proposed to optimize the performance of networked field-level process control considering network uncertainties.
An IoT-enabled control architecture of networked building field-level process control in IoT environments is designed and the essential field-level smart IoT devices are developed. The feasibility and applicability of adopting IoT technologies and wireless networks for heating, ventilation, and air-conditioning (HVAC) process controls at field level are investigated experimentally. The control adopted the proposed control architecture under the good network condition shows almost the same performance compared with that using conventional direct digital controllers (DDC), which are widely used in current BA systems. The experimental comparison proves the feasibility of adopting IoT technologies and the wireless network in networked field-level process controls.
The impacts of network constraints and component-level characteristics of HVAC devices as well as their interaction on networked field-level control are investigated. A IoT-enabled networked building field-level control simulation platform is developed for assessing such impacts, where a typical field-level HVAC process control is implemented. The component-level characteristics of the actuator and major network constraints in the networked control loop are taken into account. The results show that network constraints can significantly enlarge the faults caused by unfavorable component-level characteristics. The increased response time resulting from network delay may lead the actuator reaching the dead band. Packet loss can significantly enlarge the overshoot caused by dead band and hysteresis.
Based on the proposed control architecture and analyzing the key factors affecting network performance, different optimization methods are proposed to enhance the performance of networked field-level control in buildings. These methods include: 1) an enhanced networked control strategy proposed for control optimization by considering control design; 2) a method developed by adopting 4th generation/5th generation (4G/5G) industrial cellular networks for control optimization by using advanced network technologies; and 3) a robust networked control scheme proposed for control optimization by using compensation methods.
For the first method, the enhanced networked control strategy is proposed to enhance the networked control performance and robustness by optimizing control design. The task decomposition and distributed deployment of this strategy can significantly reduce the impacts of transmission delay and packet loss, and properly balance the different response speeds of two processes. The proposed enhanced networked control strategy has better steady-state performance in the IoT environment under different network conditions compared to the conventional strategy. It can provide stable control output even in the high dynamic region of the controlled process.
For the second method, the 4G/5G industrial cellular networks are implemented into networked field-level process control. The capability and performance of the cellular networks when applied for time-critical building control tasks, as well as the coverage and connection performance are assessed. The experimental test results show that the cellular network is capable of supporting time-critical control tasks with good control performance even in the deep area of the building. The 5G-standalone network shows attractive performance in the conditions concerned.
For the third method, the robust networked control scheme is proposed to enhance the networked control performance and improve robustness by using compensation methods. The proposed control scheme consists of a predictor and a compensator, aiming to predict the states of the networked control process when packet loss happened. The test results show that the proposed robust networked control scheme is validated as an effective option to mitigate the impacts of network constraints on control when using IoT technologies. Using the proposed control scheme, the deviation can be reduced from 13.7K to 5.8K (57.7\%) under the same period of continuous packet loss.
To conclude, this PhD study confirms the feasibility and applicability of adopting IoT technologies and wireless networks for field-level process controls in buildings. An IoT-enabled control architecture is designed and proposed as a recommendable alternative for building process controls in the next-generation of building automation systems. Considering the future development with deeper penetration of IoT technologies, the proposed architecture opens up a possibility for building automation systems to implement process controls using integrated smart IoT devices at field level with a “plug-and-play” manner. The deployment of such system could be cost-effective, as it reduces the cost associated with wiring, calibration, and configuration. Having the ability to conduct field-level building process controls in this manner, IoT technologies could play more essential role in building automation systems and have high impacts in future BA system development.},

  abstract       = {Smart campus is an emerging concept enabled by digital transformation opportunities in higher education. Smart campuses are often perceived as miniature replicas of smart cities and serve as living labs for smart technology research, development, and adoption, along with their traditional teaching, learning and research functions. There is currently a limited understanding of how the smart campus is conceptualized and practiced. This paper addresses this gap by using a systematic literature review following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) approach. The study uses four major domains of the smart campus, i.e., society, economy, environment, and governance, to classify existing research. These domains are each aligned to the central smart campus concepts of digital technology and big data. The analysis found little evidence of a comprehensive real-world application of the smart campus towards addressing all four domains. This highlights the infancy of the current conceptualization and practice. The findings contribute to the development of a new conceptual foundation and research directions for the smart campus notion and informs its practice through a conceptual framework. The findings reported in this paper offer a firm basis for comprehensive smart campus conceptualization, and also provide directions for future research and development of smart campuses.},
